# Blood-Donation-Prediction

## Description

Blood transfusion saves lives - from replacing lost blood during major surgery or a serious injury to treating various illnesses and blood disorders. Ensuring that there's enough blood in supply whenever needed is a serious challenge for the health professionals. In this capstone project, we aim to develop a predictive model that can help blood banks to identify donors who are likely to come back to donate blood based on a limited number of attributes. The model will leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze the data from previous blood donations and predict the likelihood of donors to return for subsequent donations.

The model will be developed using data obtained from a mobile blood donation vehicle in Taiwan, including information on the time since last donation, number of donation, volume of donated blood, and total month past since first donation of donors. The Blood Transfusion Service Center drives to different universities and collects blood as part of a blood drive. The developed model will be evaluated using various metrics to determine its effectiveness in predicting future donor behavior.
